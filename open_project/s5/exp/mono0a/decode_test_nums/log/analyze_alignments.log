Overall, AU accounts for 1.0% of phone occurrences, with duration (median, mean, 95-percentile) is (5,11.0,30) frames.
Overall, H accounts for 1.0% of phone occurrences, with duration (median, mean, 95-percentile) is (4,4.9,9) frames.
Overall, O accounts for 0.7% of phone occurrences, with duration (median, mean, 95-percentile) is (28,28.5,31) frames.
Overall, OE accounts for 0.6% of phone occurrences, with duration (median, mean, 95-percentile) is (14,15.2,17) frames.
The optional-silence phone SIL occupies 31.7% of frames overall 
Limiting the stats to the 92.3% of frames not covered by an utterance-[begin/end] phone, optional-silence SIL occupies 26.3% of frames.
Assuming 100 frames per second, the alignments represent 0.1 hours of data, or 0.1 hours if SIL frames are excluded.
Utterance-internal optional-silences SIL comprise 15.7% of utterance-internal phones, with duration (median, mean, 95-percentile) = (25,28.3,55)
